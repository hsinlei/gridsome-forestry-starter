## Why Is Our Health Insurance Incomplete? What Can We Do About It?

Join us for a conversation with Chris Robertson on how to address the ways that incomplete health insurance keeps people from valuable care, causes widespread anxiety, and drives many patients and their families into bankruptcy and foreclosure. Robertson is Professor of Law at the University of Arizona and author of the new book, <a href="[https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674972162](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674972162 "https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674972162")">Exposed: Why Our Health Insurance Is Incomplete and What Can Be Done about It</a>.
