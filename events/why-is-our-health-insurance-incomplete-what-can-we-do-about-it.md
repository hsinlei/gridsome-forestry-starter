Join [The Policy Lab](https://thepolicylab.brown.edu/) and the [Brown School of Public Health](https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/home) for a conversation with Chris Robertson, Professor of Law at the University of Arizona, where we'll talk about his recent book, [_Exposed: Why Our Health Insurance Is Incomplete and What Can Be Done about It_.](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674972162)

The book documents a prevailing bipartisan agreement that patients should bear a substantial portion of health care costs--through deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. In theory, this strategy should have a number of benefits, including empowering patients to make costâ€“benefit tradeoffs, and encouraging thrift and efficiency in a system rife with waste. But in practice, this cost-exposure consensus keeps people from valuable care, causes widespread anxiety, and drives many patients and their families into bankruptcy and foreclosure. Prof. Robertson will discuss these findings and some avenues for reform.
